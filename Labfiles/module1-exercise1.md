# HOL 1: Migrating Windows & SQL Server workloads

Duration: 60 minutes

In this HOL, you will use Azure Migrate: Server Assessment to assess the on-premises environment. This will include selecting Azure Migrate tools, deploying the Azure Migrate appliance into the on-premises environment, creating a migration assessment, and using the Azure Migrate dependency visualization.

### Exercise 1: Discovery, Assess, and Plan: Evaluate your current environment

In this exercise, you will deploy the Azure Migrate appliance in the on-premises Hyper-V environment. This appliance communicates with the Hyper-V server to gather configuration and performance data about your on-premises VMs, and returns that data to your Azure Migrate project.

1. If you are not logged in already, click on Azure portal shortcut that is available on the desktop and log in with below Azure credentials.
    * Azure Username/Email: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject> 
    * Azure Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

2. Click on **Show Portal Menu (1)** bar and select **All services (2)** in the portal's left navigation.

20. Log in using the below Azure credentials and select **Continue** on the **Are you trying to sign in to Microsoft Azure PowerShell?** window to complete the login process. Once you have logged in, return to the Azure Migrate Appliance tab and the appliance registration will start automatically and displays below message once the registration is successful.
    
    * Azure Username/Email: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject> 
    * Azure Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject> 

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the registration with the Azure Migrate project as completed.](Images/azmigrate-06.1.png "Appliance registered")

   Once the registration has completed, you can proceed to the next panel, **Manage credentials and discovery sources**.

21. In **Step 1: Provide Hyper-V host credentials for discovery of Hyper-V VMs** under **2. Manage credentials and discovery sources**, select **Add credentials**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the 'Add credentials' button.](Images/add-creds1.png)


22. Specify the following details on the **Add credentials** blade for the Hyper-V host/cluster that the appliance will use to discover VMs and select **Save**.
 
      1. Friendly name: Enter **hostlogin** 
      2. Username: <inject key="SmartHotelHost Admin Username" />
      3. Password: <inject key="SmartHotelHost Admin Password" />

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the 'Add credentials' panel.](Images/upd-add-creds.png "Credentials")

     > **Note**: The Azure Migrate appliance may not have picked up your local keyboard mapping. Select the 'eyeball' in the password box to check the password was entered correctly.

23. In **Step 2: Provide Hyper-V host/cluster details**, select **Add discovery source** to specify the Hyper-V host/cluster IP address/FQDN and the friendly name for credentials to connect to the host/cluster.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the 'Add discovery source' button.](Images/add-disc-1.png "Add discovery source")

24. On the **Add discovery source** blade, provide the following details:
     
      1. Select **Add single item**
      1. IP Address / FQDN:  Enter **SmartHost<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** .
      1. Friendly name: Select **hostlogin** from the dropdown and 
      1. select **Save**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the 'Add discovery source' panel.](Images/discoverysource-2.png "Discovery source - SmartHotelHost")

    > **Note:** You can either **Add single item** at a time or **Add multiple items** in one go. There is also an option to provide Hyper-V host/cluster details through **Import CSV**.

25. The appliance will validate the connection to the Hyper-V hosts/clusters added and show the **Validation status** in the table against each host/cluster

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the successful validation of the configured discovery source.](Images/discoverysourcevalidation1.png "Discovery source - validation successful")

    > **Note:** When adding discovery sources:
    > - For successfully validated hosts/clusters, you can view more details by selecting their IP address/FQDN.
    > - If validation fails for a host, review the error by selecting the Validation failed in the Status column of the table. Fix the issue and validate again.
    > - To remove hosts or clusters, select **Delete**.
    > - You can't remove a specific host from a cluster. You can only remove the entire cluster.
    > - You can add a cluster, even if there are issues with specific hosts in the cluster.

26. In **Step 3: provide server credentials to perform software inventory and agentless dependency analysis**, **Disable the slider (1)** and select **Start discovery (2)** to kick off VM discovery from the successfully validated hosts/clusters.

     > **Note:** The discovery process can take up to 10 minutes. 
   
    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the 'Start discovery' button.](Images/Discovery1.png)

27. Wait for the Azure Migrate status to show **Discovery has been successfully initiated**. This will take several minutes. After the discovery has been successfully initiated, you can check the discovery status against each host/cluster in the table.

26. Return to the **JumpVM** then to **Azure Migrate** blade in the Azure portal.  Select **Servers, databases and web apps (1)**, then select **Refresh (2)**.  Under **Azure Migrate: Servers, databases and web apps** you should see a **count (3)** of the number of servers discovered so far. If discovery is still in progress, select **Refresh** periodically until 6 discovered servers are shown. This may take several minutes.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate portal blade. Under 'Azure Migrate: Server Assessment' the value for 'discovered servers' is '5'.](Images/ex1-s28.png "Discovered servers") 

    > Note:- **Wait for the discovery process to complete before proceeding to the next Task**.
